<h4 align="center">A Luau IDE written in Luau.</h4>

Hula is a ***WIP*** IDE written in Luau with power-use and simplicity in mind. It will make use of the powerful foundations
laid by Roblox with [Luau](https://github.com/Roblox/luau), including but not limited to: **code debugging**, **disassembly**, and **intelligent type-checking**.

Hula aims to be:

* 🔧***Extensible***. Adding features should be easy for both experienced and non-experienced Luau users.
* 💨***Performant***. As a showcase of the performance of Luau, Hula should also highly performant in all areas.
* ✔️***Reliable***. Using Hula should be a smooth experience with no unexpected hangs or crashes.
* 💻***Native***. Hula should run on all platforms equally with similar performance.
* 🪶***Lightweight***. Shouldn't have many dependencies, and any dependencies (or plugins) should be decoupleable.
* 🪟***Simple, but beautiful***. A clean user interface with minimal clutter and powerful tools.

Hula does **NOT** aim to be:

* ❌***A replacement*** to your normal Luau environment, be that Roblox Studio or Visual Studio Code.
* ❌***A general purpose*** editor like Visual Studio Code and Co.
